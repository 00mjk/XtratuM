=head2 C<l3x0-3linux>: XtratuM system with three Linux partitions.

I<This example explains how to build a system composed by three Linux partitions.>

Builds a partitioned system composed by three partitions running a Linux
kernel.  The first partition gets the root file-system from the
I</dev/sda1>, while the remaining guest partitions partition get the
root file-system from an C<initramfs>.

=head3 Partition definition:

Three independent partitions with the same Linux kernel code are built.

=head3 Configuration table:

Basic configuration. Partitions are defined to be executed at different memory addresses.
P1, P2 and P3 are  defined as supervisor partitions.

A scheduling plan is defined under the following premises:

    MAF = 8 msec
    P1: S   0 ms  D 2 ms
    P2: S   2 ms  D 2 ms
    P1: S   4 ms  D 2 ms
    P3: S   6 ms  D 8 ms

=head3 Expected results:

XtratuM will load, initialise and run in user mode the Linux partitions.
During the execution, the Linux aprtitions will boot and run start a C</sbin/init>
provided inside a basic initramfs filesystem which will start a busybox shell.
