This file contains several tips on kernel parameters.
Each Linux partition gets a single command line with the
kernel parameters in a single file.


    root=<rootdev>
    
This option sets the root device. Check how your system
detects the disk drives. For example:
                     
            root=/dev/hda1   # <IDE disk>     (IO-server)
            root=/dev/sda1   # <serial disk>  (IO-server)


    spare_port_name=<name>
    
This option sets the sampling port name that will be 
used by the Linux partition to send requests to the spare 
host. Find the name in the XML configuration file.

    
    spare_port_size=<size>
    
This option sets the sampling port size. Again, find the
correct value in the XML configuration file.


    rootwait=<rootdev>
    
This is the recommended option for application Linux partitions
(not the IO server). The IO server has to boot and offer a virtual
disk to the Linux partition. However, the Linux partition may 
need the virtual disk before the server has been able to offer it. 
Therefore, we keep the Linux partition waiting until the virtual
disk is made available. More information on this parameter in the
kernel-parameters documentation of the Linux kernel.

            rootwait=/dev/vda1   # <virtual disk> (Linux partition)
