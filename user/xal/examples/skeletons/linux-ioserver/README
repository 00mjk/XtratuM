 Linux IO Server skeleton
-------------------------

This folder contains the Makefile with the required rules to build
the Linux IO Server partition. As you can see, there's no file
inside this folder other than the Makefile. In order to build a Linux
partition, it is required the compiled Linux kernel image file. 
The kernel image shall be built from the XtratuM patched kernel tree.
Therefore, the compilation should be done with this command:

	$ make ID=0 LINUX_PATH=/path/to/linux
	
NOTE: IT IS REQUIRED THAT YOU BUILD THE LINUX IO SERVER PARTITION
WITH ID=0, AS THAT IS THE WAY LINUX KNOWS IT IS THE IO SERVER.
