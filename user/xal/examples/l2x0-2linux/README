=head2 C<l2x0-2linux>: XtratuM system with two Linux partitions.

I<This example explains how to build a system composed by two Linux partitions.>

Builds a partitioned system composed by two partitions running a Linux kernel.
The first partition gets the root file-system from the I</dev/sda1>, while
the second partition gets the root file-system from an I<initramfs>.

=head3 Partition definition:

Two independent partitions with the same Linux kernel code are built.

=head3 Configuration table:

Basic configuration. Partitions are defined to be executed at different memory addresses.
P1 and P2 are  defined as supervisor partitions.

A scheduling plan is defined under the following premises:

    MAF = 10 msec
    P1: S   0 ms  D 4 ms
    P2: S   4 ms  D 4 ms

=head3 Expected results:

XtratuM will load, initialise and run in user mode the Linux partitions.
During the execution, the Linux partitions will boot and run start a C</sbin/init>
provided inside a basic initramfs filesystem which will start a busybox shell.
